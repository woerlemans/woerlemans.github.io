    <h2>Early game</h2>
    <div class="early">
        <h3>Junctios</h3>
        <p>Do all junctions until unlock entire Star Chart</p>


        <h3>Mods Focus</h3>
        <h4>Mods explained</h4>
        <img src="./image/mods/Attributes-information.webp" alt="Attributes-information" class="marleft">
        <p>1 Name and Effects</p>
        <p>2 Item Compatibility, Warframe, Rifle, Shotgun</p>
        <p>3 Special Indicator, like Auro, Stance, Exilus, Riven</p>
        <p>4 Drain and Polarity symbol, how much capacity is used and if symbol is the same less is used</p>
        <p>5 Rank, from 0 to max, cost endo to level up and capacity costs usualy increases on higher rank
        </p>
        <p>6 Stack/Quantity, number of the same rank and same mod you own</p>
        <p>7 Rarity, color of the mod</p>

        <h4>Ways to increase Capacity</h4>
        <p>You can increase your mod capacity by leveling the item, installing an Orokin Catalyst or Reactor
            in the "Actions" tab, or by installing Forma to add additional polarities. </p>
        <p>Orokin Catalyst and Reactors may be purchased from Nora Night in the Nightwave menu</p>
        <p>Forma is a potential reward from opening Void Relicsâ€”a system you unlock upon completing the
            Earth -> Mars Junction.</p>

        <h4>Warframe</h4>
        <p>First survivability then ability focus and then focus on two of the following: Ability Strength,
            Duration, Range, and Efficiency</p>
        <p>Recommended: <br> First mods like Redirection (mod) (warframe) or Vitality (mod) (warframe) <br>
            Then mods with Ability Efficiency, like Streamline (mod) (warframe) and Fleeting Expertise (mod)
            (warframe) <br> And either Ability Strength or Range</p>

        <h4>Weapons</h4>
        <p>Focus on base damage, multishot, and combined elements, then status change or critical effects
        </p>
        <p>Most Primary wepons builds use: Serration, Split Chamber, Infected Clip, and Cryo Rounds (this
            creates viral damage)</p>


        <h3>Expand Mods</h3>
        <h4>Replace all broken mods</h4>
        <p>broken mods aren't worth it</p>
        <h4>Get Streamline (mod) (warframe) // +30% Ability Efficiency</h4>
        <p>Obtain: Complete low-level Cetus bounties on Earth</p>

        <h4>Elemental mods (mod) (weapon) // 90% Heat, Toxin, Cold, or Electricity damage</h4>
        <p>Complete Junctions and defeat enemies to get these mods.</p>
        <p>Corrosive (Electricity + Toxin) => Strong against armor, weak against shield => Steel Path
            enemies, mainly enemies with ferrite armor (Grineer)</p>

                src="./image/mods/InfectedClipMod.webp" alt=""></div>

        <p>(optional) Magnetic (Cold + Electricity) increase damage to shields, Toxin completely ignores
            normal shields</p>

        <h3>Farm Boss Fights</h3>
        <p>Nearly every boss drops components for new weapons or warframes.</p>
        <p>(if new) We highly recommend you farm the Jackel boss on Fossa, Venus. This will drop parts for
            the
            Rhino warframe. Easily one of the game's best early characters </p>
        <ul class="marleft">Warframes require:
            <li>Warframe blueprint => bought in-game market for credits</li>
            Then craft the following parts
            <li><img src="./icon/Systems.webp" alt="System"> System blueprint => Jackel boss, mission Fossa
                (venus)</li>
            <li><img src="./icon/Helmet.webp" alt="Helmet"> Neuroptics blueprint => Jackel boss, mission
                Fossa
                (venus)</li>
            <li><img src="./icon/Chassis.webp" alt="Chassis"> Chassis blueprint => Jackel boss, mission
                Fossa
                (venus)</li>
            after crafting the parts you can craft the warframe.
